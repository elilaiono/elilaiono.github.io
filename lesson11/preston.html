                <h2>The Founders of Preston, Idaho</h2>
                <p><img class="article-img" src="images/clouds-preston.jpg" alt="picture of the clouds">Located on the
                    flat, at the junction of
                    Highways 91 and 36 is the county seat of Franklin County: Preston, Idaho. Prior to 1881, the flat
                    was known as “Worm Creek”
                    [pronounced “crick”]. Those that settled this area were predominantly Mormon and their leadership
                    came from the LDS Church
                    President in Salt Lake City, Utah. The name Preston was chosen for the area in the following manner
                    as recorded by Baltzer
                    Peterson:<br><br>
            
                    On May 14, 1881, a special meeting was held. Some of the Church Leaders at Salt Lake City objected
                    to the name “Worm Creek” as
                    pertaining to any Church Organization. They thought that a more appropriate name should be given the
                    Ward for they were not in
                    favor of the name “Worm” being used when it pertained to anything connected with the Church. Mrs.
                    Rachel Porter, wife of Bishop
                    Porter, had the privilege of suggesting the name “Preston” in honor of Bishop William B. Preston of
                    the Cache Stake, and who
                    later became the presiding Bishop of the Church. Thus Preston became the name of the Ward and the
                    Community.<br><br>

                    The first permanent residence within the present city limits of Preston was established by Dennis W.
                    Winn in 1868. He built a
                    frame home 32 by 16 feet. The house was located a mile southeast of the city center. Due to the lack
                    of water on the sand ridge
                    or the Preston Flat, settlements had surrounded the Flat before the first homes were built there.
